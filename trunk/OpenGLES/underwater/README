
This OpenGL program demonstrates the simulation of underwater caustics.
Underwater caustics are the patterns of light that occur when light is
refracted by the surface of water such that the light focuses (brightens)
and unfocuses (dims) on underwater surfaces.

If you swim underwater in a swimming pool, you know the sort of caustic
patterns that I am describing.

Correct physical simulation of underwater caustics is very involved.
See the discussion in Watt & Watt's book "Advanced Animation and Rendering
Techniques" (Section 10.1.5).  The demo program in this directory is a
hack that creates the illusion of underwater caustics using a sequence
of texture images.

The program uses a sequence of 32 texture images that repeat in
both spatially (ie, a single image will tile) and temporally (ie,
the sequence of images progresses naturally and the final image loops
back to the beginning).  The texture images were created by Jos Stam
(jstam@aw.sgi.com) using Fourier synthesis.

Angus Dorbie's IRIS Performer underwater demo inspired this simple
example.  Thanks, Jos and Angus for the textures and inspiration.

The caust*.bw images are in the SGI image file format.

When available, the program uses the ARB_multitexture extension (supported
by the NVIDIA Riva TNT) to render the underwater floor surface with the
caustic effect modulated in with a single rendering pass.
