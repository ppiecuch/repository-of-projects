	Centering: Auto-width Margins
	This box is horizontally centered by setting its right and left margin widths to "auto". 
	This is the preferred way to accomplish horizontal centering with CSS, and works very well in most browsers with CSS2 support.

	<!--
	vertical-align:middle because it's not applicable to block-level elements
	margin-top:auto and margin-bottom:auto because their used values would compute as zero

	<!--
	Calculating heights and margins

	For calculating the values of 'top', 'margin-top', 'height', 'margin-bottom', and 'bottom' a distinction must be made between various kinds of boxes:

   1. inline, non-replaced elements
   2. inline, replaced elements
   3. block-level, non-replaced elements in normal flow
   4. block-level, replaced elements in normal flow
   5. floating, non-replaced elements
   6. floating, replaced elements
   7. absolutely positioned, non-replaced elements
   8. absolutely positioned, replaced elements
   9. 'inline-block', non-replaced elements in normal flow
  10. 'inline-block', replaced elements in normal flow

	There isn't one easy way to center div vertically which would do the trick in every situation.

	However, there are lots of ways to do it depending on the situation.
	
	Here are few of them:
	
	    * Set top and bottom padding of the parent element for example padding:20px 0px 20px 0px
	    * Use table, table cell centers its' content vertically
	    * Set parent element's position relative and the div's you want to vertically center to absolute and style it as top:50px; bottom:50px; for example
	
	You may also google for "css vertical centering"
