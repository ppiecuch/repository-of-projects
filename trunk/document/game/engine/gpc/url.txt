GPC Features
Difference, intersection, exclusive-or and union clip operations are supported. 
Polygons may be comprised of multiple disjoint contours. 
Contour vertices may be given in any order - clockwise or anticlockwise. 
Contours may be convex, concave or self-intersecting. 
Contours may be nested (i.e. polygons may have holes). 
Output may take the form of either polygon contours or tristrips. 
Hole and external contours are differentiated in the result. 
Coincident edges and degenerate regions are handled correctly.
