Here is a step-by-step process for getting FMOD running in an iOS application:

File -> New Project 
iOS -> Application -> Window based application 
Choose name and location (I used 'test' and the FMOD examples directory as the location) 
Assuming you named the app 'test', rename 'testAppDelegate.m' to have the extension '.mm' to allow C++ code. 
Edit 'testAppDelegate.mm' to have #import "fmod.hpp" at the top. 
Project -> Edit project settings (ensure Configuration at the top is set to All configurations) 
Go to "Other linker flags" and type in -lfmodex_$PLATFORM_NAME 
Go to "Header search paths" and type in ../../api/inc 
Go to "Library search paths" and type in ../../api/lib (now close settings). 
Right click on the "Frameworks" group on the left, choose Add -> Existing Frameworks, then choose 'CoreAudio.framework' 
Repeat step 10 but choose 'AudioToolbox.framework' 
Add FMOD code to 'testAppDelegate.mm' as needed, see playSound example for reference code.
