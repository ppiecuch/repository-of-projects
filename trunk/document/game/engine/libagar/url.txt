Agar is a powerful open-source, cross-platform toolkit for graphical applications in C, 
C++ or Objective-C (bindings to Perl and Ada are also available). Designed for ease of integration, 
Agar follows the philosophy of building the GUI around the application, and not the other way around. 
Agar applications should work seamlessly under any platform, and Agar itself should work without relying on 
other libraries (Agar 1.4 can be compiled without dependencies, and has even been used on embedded devices without 
filesystems or operating systems at all).
 When compiled with optional threads support, Agar's entire documented API is thread-safe.
