JaegerMonkey (or JagerMonkey) is a new method JIT for SpiderMonkey. The goal is to get reliable baseline performance on the order of other JS JIT systems. JM will be a baseline whole-method JIT that doesn't necessarily do many traditional compiler optimizations. Instead, it does dynamic-language-JIT-oriented optimizations like PICs and specialization of constant operands.
