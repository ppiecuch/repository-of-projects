ZeroBrane Studio is a lightweight Lua IDE with code completion, syntax highlighting, code analyzer, live coding, and debugging support for Lua 5.1, Lua 5.2, LuaJIT, and other Lua engines.

It is simple and instantly usable for beginners (as tested with middle and high school students with no programming experience), yet feature-rich and extensible for experienced developers. Unlike Eclipse and IntelliJ, it has a small footprint and is completely customizable with Lua. Unlike TextMate and Sublime Text, it includes a remote debugger and a full IDE feature set. Unlike Decoda, it runs on Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux and supports on-device debugging.

ZeroBrane Studio also provides several unique features: live coding for immediate feedback, Markdown formatting in comments for providing instructions with minimal context switching, and integrated interactive materials for those learning Lua or getting familiar with programming.

For those interested in game and mobile development, it supports debugging for L?ve 2D, Moai, Gideros, Marmalade Quick, Corona, and Cocos2d-x.
