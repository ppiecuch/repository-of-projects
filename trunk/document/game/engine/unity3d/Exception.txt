Problem with speed reset after crossfadeQueued
[Analyse]
CrossFadeQueued is not supposed to clone properties from "original" state, it only finds clip with same name (at least as far as I remember). You can always do this:

AnimationState newWalk = objanimation.CrossFadeQueued("walk",0.2f,QueueMode.PlayNow);
newWalk.speed = 2;
