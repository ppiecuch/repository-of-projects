ZXing (pronounced "zebra crossing") is an open-source, multi-format 1D/2D barcode image processing library implemented in Java. Our focus is on using the built-in camera on mobile phones to photograph and decode barcodes on the device, without communicating with a server. We currently have support for: 

UPC-A and UPC-E 
EAN-8 and EAN-13 
Code 39 
Code 93 
Code 128 
QR Code 
ITF 
Codabar 
RSS-14 (all variants) 
Data Matrix 
PDF 417 ('alpha' quality) 
Aztec ('alpha' quality) 
This library is divided into several components; some are actively supported: 

core: The core image decoding library, and test code 
javase: J2SE-specific client code 
android: Android client, called Barcode Scanner 
androidtest: Android test app 
android-integration: Supports integration with our Barcode Scanner app via Intent 
zxingorg: The source behind zxing.org/w 
zxing.appspot.com: The source behind our web-based barcode generator 
Some modules are contributed and/or intermittently maintained: 

javame: JavaME client 
csharp: Partial C# port 
cpp: Partial C++ port 
rim: RIM/Blackberry-specific client build 
iphone: iPhone client + port to Objective C / C++ (QR code only) 
bug: Client for BugLabs's BUG 
jruby: Ruby wrapper 
actionscript: partial port to Actionscript 
To complement our decoding software, we have created a web-based QR Code generator which supports contact information, calendar events, URLs, and much more.
