My understanding is...

PhysicsWorlds (PW) carry out all calculations on a per-frame basis (e.g. updates are based on your FPS)
FixedStepPhysicsWorlds (FSW) carry out all calculations a fixed number of times per second regardless of FPS(*)

This means that PWs produce different results depending the FPS your App is running. 

FSWs create replicable simulations regardless of the actual FPS you're getting on the device(*)

In most cases you'd only use FSWs where you want the same result every time on every device (simulations or precision puzzles) but I've also found that it reduces 'weird things' happening when background tasks on the phone intrude into your game - e.g. I use FSWs all the time...

(*) If your FPS drops below your FixedStep size, weird stuff may start to happen - so set your FixedStep lower than your lowest likely FPS - or expect non-reproducable simulations...Tasty Android Snacks - http://www.somewhatdog.com
