On terminal,

$defaults write com.apple.dt.XCode IDEIndexDisable 1

You'll lose some features (autocomplete, jump to definition, some of the assistants won't work right). But you'll gain back ram and cpu.

For my project Xcode went from using 2 Gigs to a few hundred MB. (which I sorely needed to compile with ;)

If you want to enable it again:

$defaults delete com.apple.dt.XCode IDEIndexDisable
