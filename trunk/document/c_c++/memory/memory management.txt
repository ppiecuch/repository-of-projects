Memory affects performance in two ways:
1¡¢Dynamic memory allocation via malloc() or C++'s global operator new is a very slow operation.
We can improve the performance of our code by either avoiding dynamic allocation altogether or 
by making use of custom memory allocators that greatly reduce allocation costs.
2¡¢On modern CPUs, the performance of a piece of software is often dominated by its memory access
patterns. As we'll see, data that is located in small, contiguous blocks of memory can be operated
on much more efficiently by the CPU than if that same data were to be spread out across a wide 
range of memory addresses. Even the most efficient algorithm, coded with the utmost care, can be 
brought to its knees if the data upon which it operates is not laid out efficiently in memory.
