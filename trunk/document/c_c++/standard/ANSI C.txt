ANSI C refers to the family of successive standards published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for the C programming language. 
Software developers writing in C are encouraged to conform to the standards, as doing so aids portability between compilers.

ANSI C是美国国家标准协会(ANSI)对C语言发布的标准。使用C的软件开发者被鼓励遵循ANSI C文档的要求，因为它鼓励使用跨平台的代码。


History and outlook

The first standard for C was published by ANSI. 
Although this document was subsequently adopted by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 
and subsequent revisions published by ISO have been adopted by ANSI, the name ANSI C (rather than ISO C) is still more widely used. 
While some software developers use the term ISO C, others are standards bodyCneutral and use Standard C.

C 的第一个标准是由ANSI发布的。虽然这份文档后来被国际标准化组织(ISO)采纳并且ISO发布的修订版也被ANSI采纳了，
但名称ANSI C(而不是 ISO C)仍被广泛使用。一些软件开发者使用ISO C，还有一些使用 Standard C。


C89 and C90
In 1983, the American National Standards Institute formed a committee, X3J11, to establish a standard specification of C. 
After a long and arduous process, the standard was completed in 1989 and ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 "Programming Language C." 
This version of the language is often referred to as "ANSI C", or sometimes "C89" (to distinguish it from C99).
The same standard was ratified by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, 
with only formatting changes,[1] which is sometimes referred to as C90. 
Therefore, the terms "C89" and "C90" refer to essentially the same language.
ISO also published an amendment in 1994, referred to as AMD1, introducing minor changes to the language and the library.
This standard has been withdrawn by both INCITS and ISO/IEC.

C89
1983年，美国国家标准协会组成了一个委员会，X3J11，为了创立 C 的一套标准。
经过漫长而艰苦的过程，该标准于1989年完成，并在作为ANSI X3.159-1989 "Programming Language C"正式生效。
这个版本的语言经常被称作"ANSI C"，或有时称为"C89"（为了区别C99）。
C90
在1990年，ANSI C标准（带有一些小改动）被美国国家标准协会采纳为ISO/IEC 9899:1990。这个版本有时候称为C90。因此，C89和C90通常指同一种语言。



C99
In March 2000, ANSI adopted the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard. This standard is commonly referred to as C99.
This standard has been withdrawn by ISO/IEC in favour of C11, but is still approved by INCITS.

C99
在2000年三月，ANSI 采纳了 ISO/IEC 9899:1999 标准。这个标准通常指C99。


C11
"C11" is the new standard for the C programming language.
C11
在2011年12月，ANSI 采纳了 ISO/IEC 9899:2011 标准。这个标准通常即C11，它是C程序语言的现行标准。
