An easier way than what Richie mentioned is to the following: 

if a point P is inside triangle ABC, then 

Area PAB+Area PBC +Area PAC=Area ABC 

notice that if P is on the edge of AB, BC, or CA, the above hold. But effectively, one of the area PAB, PBC, PAC is 0 (so just make sure you check that). 

if P is outside, the above equality does NOT hold... 

How to determine area? you have two options: 
1) Heron's theorem, involves sqrt, slower 
2) the more perferred way is the cross products (or effectively, the half of absolute value of (sum of the down products minus the sum of up products)) 

for example, if A=(x1,y1) B=(x2,y2), C=(x3,y3) 
Area= abs(x1*y2+x2*y3+x3*y1-x1*y3-x3*y2-x2*y1)/2 

also you might want to be careful about floating point errors... instead of checking for strict inequality, 
check for abs(b-a)<eps, where eps can be a small value, such as 1e-12 (0.000000000001)
